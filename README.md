# LTE-Dynamic-Resource-Allocation-Optimization-Scheduling-Task Prioritization

This repository contains an **optimized resource allocation system** that dynamically distributes resources based on **task priority and availability**. The project implements **priority queues and optimization techniques** for efficient scheduling.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Priority-Based Task Scheduling** to allocate resources efficiently.  
- **Dynamic Resource Management** for real-time adaptation.  
- **Queue-Based Processing** using heap-based priority queues.  
- **Customizable Resource Constraints & Task Parameters**.

## 📌 Installation  
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resource_Allocation_Project.git
cd Resource_Allocation_Project
### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv resource_env
source resource_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: resource_env\Scripts\activate
### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 🛠 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
Open resource_allocation_project.ipynb and execute the cells to simulate resource allocation.

# 🔍 How It Works
Task Representation:

Each task has an ID, priority, and resource requirement.

Priority Queue for Task Scheduling:

Implements heap-based priority queue for efficient allocation.

Dynamic Resource Allocation Strategy:

Resources are allocated based on task priority & availability.

Optimized real-time scheduling algorithm ensures fairness.

Visualization & Performance Analysis:

Compares different scheduling approaches.

Analyzes resource utilization efficiency.

# 📊 Analysis
Evaluates task completion efficiency under various allocation strategies.

Optimizes resource usage while minimizing task waiting times.
